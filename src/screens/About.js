        I am a Self-Taught Front-End Developer with over 2 years of experience
        that enjoys creating responsive and interactive websites and
        applications. I am currently skilled in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap,
        JavaScript and ReactJs. I am a life-long learner and I enjoy learning
        new things everyday. My quest for learning has prompted curiosity to
        know how the backend technology works, hence, I am learning about Nodejs
        and Express.
        <br /> <br />I have a Bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I
        forward to contributing to my skills and education to an organization
        that fosters growth, learning and career progression.
