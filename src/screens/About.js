        I have a Bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I started out as an
        information technology assistant and moved on to become a technical
        support engineer. During this period, I gained experience in people
        management and excellent customer science while working with different
        people in different roles.
        <br /> <br />
        After realizing my passion for software development, I took courses from
        various online site like coursera, freecodecamp and udacity. Afterwards,
        I was opportuned to be part of a 3 months immersive program by Facebook
        called DevC Training in collaboration with Andela learning community
        (ALC). The program taught basic to immediate skills of a full-stack
        developer. Furthermore, I went on to learn about ReactJs in other to
        build exceptional beautiful user-interfaces.
        <br /> <br />I am presently looking to land my first job as a frontend
        developer in an organization that fosters growth, learning and career
        progression. I also look to contribute immersely to this organization
        through my education, previous skills and acquired knowledge.
